# MarpII-Descriptor

Multiple descriptor helpers. This mostly contains a self managing descriptor pool as well as `ManagedDescriptorSet`s which keep their needed resources alive.

Later this will also include a `BindlessDescriptorSet` helper that allows registering and de-registering resources on a bindless setup.
