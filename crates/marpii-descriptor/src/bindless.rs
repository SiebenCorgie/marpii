/// Bindless descriptor helper. Manages a single big descriptor sset that binds all resources.
/// in the shader there is one binding per descriptor type (Sampled Image, Storage Image, Buffer), each binding is a array of multiple
/// images/buffers that can be indexed.
///
/// # Queue ownership
/// Since the bindless descriptorset does not take care of queue ownership you have to make sure that:
///
/// 1. The descriptor set is used only on the same queue family
/// 2. bound resoureces are owned by this queue family
/// 3. bound resources are in the correct access-mask / image-layout for the intended access
///
/// Note that the `marpii-command-graph` crate can also handle bindless handle transitions (in the same way it handles normal image/buffer resources). So if you are using this bindless helper and the command graph, just submit images/buffers as `StImage` and `StBuffer`.
///
/// # In shader usage
/// ðŸ‘·TODOðŸ‘·
///
/// # Safety
/// Note that the helper assumes that the resources are used on the correct queue, and with he correct layouts. It does not track queue ownership or layout tranisitons for you.
