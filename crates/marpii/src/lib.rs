//! # MarpII
//!
//! ðŸš§ Todo: Write some general words and a small example on how to get started. ðŸš§
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! In general marpii provides you with transparent wrappers around the main vulkan objects. This includes the [Instance](context::Instance), [Device](context::Device) and other lifetime sensitive structures. Those wrappers, if used, keep track of lifetimes
//! and destruction of those objects when not needed anymore. Usually there are some helpers to simplify the creation of
//! those. They can however also be created by hand.
//!
//!
//! Structures that are not sensitive to lifetime requirements (like create infos) are not wrapped.
