//! ## Context
//!
//! When working with Vulkan the [Device](ash::Device) is entry point for most of the operations.
//! It therefore is needed in most structures and functions calls that somehow transform state related to Vulkan.
//! The device is created from an [Instance](ash::Instance) which represents a runtime instance of Vulkan.
//!
//! Additionally to the device one or multiple [queues](ash::vk::Queue) might be created. They can be understood as
//! a kind of "thread". Basically they are used for scheduling work on the GPU. Multiple queue types exists that can
//! do different types of work.
//!
//!
//! When working with buffers (and images) another structure, the allocator is relevant.
//! It takes care of tracking where and which memory is in-use on the GPU etc.
//!
//! Since those four structures closely work together we define an abstraction called [Ctx](Ctx), or "Context".
//!
//! The `Instance` and `Device` are always created by ash, the allocator however can be defined by the
//! application. Have a look at the [allocator](crate::allocator) module for its definition and default implementation.
//!
//! # Examples
//! ðŸš§ Todo: show several examples on how to create an instance, device, queue or context, from least verbose to most verbose. ðŸš§
//!
