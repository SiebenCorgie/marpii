# Crates

This is the main crates repository. Contrary to the examples repository this contains mostly libraries.

- marpii: main Vulkan wrapper
- marpii-commandes: CommandBuffer related helpers.
- marpii-descriptor: Descriptor(Set) related helpers
- marpii-rmg: ResourceManagingGraph implementation. Much more highlevel compared to *raw* vulkan/marpii
- marpii-rmg-task: General purpose task collections. Contains a shader builder that sets up compiled shaders when building the crate.
